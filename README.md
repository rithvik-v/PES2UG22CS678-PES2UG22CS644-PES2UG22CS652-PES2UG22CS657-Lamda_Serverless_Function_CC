Lambda - Serverless Function Execution Platform
Project Overview
This project aims to build a serverless function execution platform similar to AWS Lambda. It allows users to deploy and execute Python & JavaScript functions on demand via HTTP requests. The system will support Docker and another virtualization technology (Firecracker, Nanos, or gVisor) to optimize execution.

Features
Deploy and execute functions via API
Support for Python & JavaScript functions
Virtualization using Docker + one more (Firecracker/Nanos/gVisor)
Monitoring Dashboard for real-time execution metrics
CI/CD pipeline for continuous integration and deployment
